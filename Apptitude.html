      <li><span>Aptitude</span> is the ability or potential to acquire a certain skill or knowledge. 
        It is often measured through aptitude tests, which assess a person's natural
         abilities in areas such as math, verbal reasoning, and spatial reasoning. 
         Aptitude tests are often used by employers to screen job candidates and by schools 
         to place students in appropriate academic programs.</li><br>
         <li>
          <span>Reasoning</span> is the ability to think logically and solve problems. 
          It is a complex cognitive process that involves a number of different skills, 
          such as identifying patterns, making inferences, and evaluating evidence. 
          Reasoning is essential for many aspects of life, including making decisions, 
          solving problems, and understanding complex concepts.

        <li>Statement and Conclusion: In this type of question, a statement is given followed by a conclusion. The test-taker is asked to determine whether the conclusion is logically implied by the statement. There are three possible answers for these questions:
        </li><br>
        Definitely true: The conclusion is logically implied by the statement, and there is no other possibility.
       <br> Possibly true: The conclusion is implied by the statement, but there is not enough information to determine whether it is definitely true.
       <br> Definitely false: The conclusion is not implied by the statement, and there is no other possibility.
        <br>
        <li>        Assumptions: In this type of question, a statement is given, and the test-taker is asked to identify the underlying assumptions of the statement. An assumption is an unstated belief or fact that is necessary for the statement to be true. There can be multiple assumptions for a given statement, and the test-taker may be asked to identify all of them.
